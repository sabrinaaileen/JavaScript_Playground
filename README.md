# Sabrina's JavaScript Playground 🎮

Welcome to my little JavaScript playground!  
This is where I experiment with functions, DOM manipulation, event listeners, visual effects, and whatever else I'm curious about. It's a space to practice, learn, and explore what's possible with plain Vanilla JS.

## 🔧 Technologies
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Vanilla JavaScript

## ✨ Features
- Interactive DOM elements (click events, layout changes)  
- Dynamic content  
- Mini UI experiments  
- Focus on learning through doing

## 🎯 Purpose
This project is not a finished product — it's a creative playground to **practice**, **understand**, and **grow** as a developer. A space where I can just have fun playing with code.

## 🛠️ What’s Next
I plan to add more features, mini games, or fun effects regularly — always following the motto: *Learning by playing*.
